# clickStream
a sample clickstream test 

# problem statement scope
- The problem might be underspecified. Please feel free to ask questions.
- In the programming language of your choice,
- implement an API that takes the filename of a
- comma-separated value (CSV) file and provides
- convenient access to its values.
- Hereâ€™s an example of a CSV file, is ASCII text.
- load a file that is myfile.txt from file system

- location,employee,favorite fruit 
- Assumption is: dynamic keys , dynamic length
- Austin,Alice,Apple // values1 -> A choice: whether or not that we convert into an array that deletes , or just store as JSON
- Boston,Bob,Bosc Pear // values2

# Initial requirements discussed:
- Assumption is that we have a website that generates tuples like Google Double click, not an input file stream like above.
- Design considerations were to consider an infinite length tuple stream like from Google Click Stream
- See specification here: https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/quickstart-google-analytics-clickstream-data/

# Design consideration options:
- Persistent storage and query interface design considerations for later:
- This could be stored downstream into Google Big Table , after loading into a HashSet for quickly accessing records.
- This could be stored downstream into an S3 bucket using AWS glue with Presto or Athena for fast query
- This could be stored downstream into a Cassandra table and queried with 2ndary indexes
- This could be loaded into memory using Redis and then persisted to MongoDB/Atlas.
- This could be loaded into Snowflake for fast query
- This could be loaded into a Databrick and queried with Spark dataframes.
- This could be stored on AWS S3 using Kinesis (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/create-real-time-clickstream-sessions-and-run-analytics-with-amazon-kinesis-data-analytics-aws-glue-and-amazon-athena/)

# Design choices:
- Path selected was (dynamic key size and dynamic length), however testcase assumed a length, this can be changed.
- Path selected is storage in Google Big Table and Google Big Query -> cheap and fast
- Path selected is AWS with Kinesis and S3 buckets for clickstream data -> can execute queries using AWS and Glue 

# Tests executed:

# Example Test output:

[RedSox, 1,2, Boston,Bob,Bosc, Austin,Alice,Apple] // echoes input stream tuples

true // finds redsox wins the world series
